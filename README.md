# MY Bug Report Analyzer 
This is my personal AI-powered project designed to analyze and summarize bug reports efficiently.  
It uses **Python, Streamlit, LangChain, and OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** to automatically extract key insights such as  
**vulnerability type, severity level, root cause, and recommended fix** from large security reports.

I built this tool to assist my daily workflow as a **Bug Hunter**, helping me quickly review and understand  
complex vulnerability data. The systemâ€™s **prompts are fully customizable**, so I can easily modify them to perform  
other tasks like code analysis, payload review, or summarizing penetration testing results.

ðŸ’¡ The main goal is to transform manual bug analysis into a fast, intelligent AI-driven process.
